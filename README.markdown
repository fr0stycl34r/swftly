# Swftly - I don't like swfs.

Swftly is a tiny gem that abstracts interactions with Google's Swiffy service. This project came about because I needed to push something like 6,000 individual swfs through Swiffy. I guess I could have used [Google's Flash extension](https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/extension.html), but making a gem seemed like more fun.

## Installation...

    $ gem install swftly

Or, in your Gemfile:

    gem 'swftly'

### Using Swftly

```ruby
the_swf = '/absolute/path/to/yourfile.swf'
swftly = Swftly.new(the_swf) #fire her up
swftly.swiff #send the_swf off to Google's hosted service for conversion

#the runtime class has info about Swiffy's client-side runtime.js
swftly.runtime.version #=> "v5.2"
swftly.runtime.url     #=> "https://www.gstatic.com/swiffy/v5.2/runtime.js"

#TODO: the swiffyobject class lets you work with the javascript generated by Swiffy
swftly.swiffyobject #=> "does stuff soon"
```

### Under the Hood

Swftly takes two arguments, both optional, when instantiating. The first is a String representing the path to a swf file and is accessible on the object as `swf_path`. The second, available on the object as `auto_process`, is a boolean that, when true, automatically triggers post-processing the conversion result. This post-processing creates and populates the Runtime and SwiffyObject class objects.

If `auto_process` is false, calling `Swftly#swiff` will post the swf to Swiffy and set `Swftly.converter_response_code` and `Swftly.raw`. This is helpful if you're batching many swfs for conversion because it allows for confirmation of a successful conversion (response code == 200) before trying to do any of the post-processing.

Also, both `swf_path` and `auto_process` are attr_accessible. Setting a new swf_path and calling `Swftly#swiff` will generate a new set of conversion data, allowing ony instance to perform many conversions.
